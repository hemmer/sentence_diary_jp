# Japanese Language Diary / 日本語の日記

This project provides a way to practice writing regular sentences in Japanese, where the interface automatically converts
to kana. It was derived from the [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world).

 # Development

> pip install -r requirements.txt
